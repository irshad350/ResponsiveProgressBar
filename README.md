### Description :-
This is multi step progress bar. We can add n number of steps to this progress bar. but at a time only 24 steps will be visible to user.
### Example :- 
If we have 34 steps and current step is at 19 then we will display the progress bar from 10-33 steps. so that we can track previous steps as well as next steps.
